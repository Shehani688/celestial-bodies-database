Celestial Bodies Database
Description
The Celestial Bodies Database is a project that stores and organizes data on various celestial bodies such as stars, planets, moons, and galaxies in an SQL database. This database allows users to efficiently store and query important attributes of celestial bodies like mass, size, distance, and more. It serves as a comprehensive resource for astronomers, space enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the study of space.

Features
Comprehensive data: Includes detailed information about celestial bodies like stars, planets, moons, and galaxies.

SQL queries: The database supports complex queries to retrieve information such as the mass, size, and distance of celestial bodies.

Easy to use: The SQL file can be easily imported into any MySQL database for use.
